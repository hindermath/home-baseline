## Preflight Results

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Branch and ancestry | Pass | Branch `021-terminal-charset-hardening`; `HEAD`, merge-base, and `origin/main` were `26cf842118b97b133bfe99e4c82759db9c2b40f2` before feature edits |
| Feature metadata | Pass | `.specify/feature.json` references `specs/021-terminal-charset-hardening` |
| `specify check` | Pass | CLI ready; required local agent/tool integrations detected |
| PowerShell prerequisites | Pass | Feature directory and research/model/contracts/quickstart/tasks resolved |
| Checklists | Pass | requirements 16/16, domain 16/16, plan quality 16/16, plan review 12/12 |
| Presets | Pass | security 0.6.0/10; architecture 0.5.0/20; isaqb 0.2.0/30; a11y 0.4.0/40; cross-platform 0.2.0/50; agent-parity 0.3.0/60 |
| Governance conflict | None | Accepted 021 artifacts align with Constitution, current preset matrix, and Feature-020 baseline |
| Initial scope diff | Pass | `git diff -- tv203s/ examples/` empty before implementation |

## Optional Command Disposition

| Command | Result | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `speckit-constitution` | N/A | Constitution and six-preset matrix contain no material conflict requiring amendment |
| `speckit-taskstoissues` | N/A | One dependency-ordered, single-writer feature PR is the delivery unit; remote issue fan-out would add no proof |

## Compile-Surface Review

| Surface | Result | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| Project graph | Pass | Drivers.Console -> Core; Controls -> Drivers.Console/Core; Compatibility -> Core; no cycle or new reference required |
| Cells and snapshots | Pass | Existing `TConsoleCell`, `TConsoleBuffer`, Driver resize/presentation, and Controls draw-buffer contracts are sufficient |
| Imports and XML docs | Pass | New public Driver/Controls contracts require complete bilingual XML docs; no undocumented public API is accepted |
| Harness helpers | Pass | Existing Controls app-loop and buffer/cell proof patterns can host `TTerminalView` without an example project |
| Ownership assertions | Pass | Tests will assert exact session/view identity, lifecycle, cursor, status, profile metadata, and cells rather than text alone |
| Assembly identity | Pass | Session types compile once in Drivers.Console and are referenced by Controls/tests; no linked-source identity assumption |
| Compatibility boundary | Pass | `TConsoleInputAdapter` remains in Compatibility; no duplication, move, or Drivers reference is planned |
| Parser ownership | Pass | No reusable session/parser currently exists; Drivers.Console is the smallest non-visual owner |
| Placeholder and ID scan | Pass | No unresolved clarification, TODO/TBD, temporary requirement suffix, duplicate task, or task gap |
| Historical/example diff | Pass | `git diff -- tv203s/ examples/` empty before and after read-only review |

## Session and Emulation Matrix

| Area | Required accepted proof | Required boundary/negative proof | State publication rule | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Text and cells | Printable text, wrap, scroll, clipping | Empty, one-cell, one-row, disposed | Complete observation once | Pass: `TerminalSessionTests` |
| C0 controls | BEL, BS, TAB, CR, LF | Edge positions, mixed CR/LF, no host BEL | Complete control once | Pass: expanded `TerminalSessionTests` |
| Cursor | CSI A/B/C/D, H/f | Defaults, zero, 9,999, clamp, 10,000 reject | Atomic | Pass: relative/absolute matrix |
| Erase | CSI J/K documented modes | Unsupported mode, malformed/truncated | Atomic | Pass: modes 0/1/2 and negative matrix |
| Attributes | CSI m reset and 16 colors | Unsupported code, parameter overflow | Atomic | Pass: all 16 foreground/background colors |
| Reset/lifecycle | Reset, close, capability loss, dispose | Repeated cleanup, input after close | Idempotent | Pass: reset/close/dispose and shared capability cleanup contract |
| Recovery | Next valid text/sequence | Unknown, 63/64/65 chars, 4/5 params | No next-input loss | Pass: exact size/parameter/value and recovery matrix |
| History/resize | FIFO 4,096, top-left preservation | 4,095/4,096/4,097, shrink/grow | Bounded | Pass: exact history and resize tests |

### Session Red/Green Evidence

| Attempt | Version | Result | Boundary |
|---:|---|---|---|
| Red 1 | `1.21.0.144` | Expected compile failure | Missing `TerminalSession`, lifecycle, and result contracts only |
| Green attempt 1 | `1.21.0.145` | 9/11 | Test precision corrected: CR/LF row placement and evicted-cell count semantics |
| Green attempt 2 | `1.21.0.146` | 10/11 | Final boundary assertion used write count instead of evicted-cell count |
| Green 1 | `1.21.0.147` | 11/11 | Text, cursor, snapshots, delayed wrap, scroll, 4,095/4,096/4,097 history, resize, atomic rejection/recovery, reset/close/dispose passed |

The initial red matrix stayed in one Driver-owned file and named every expected
state boundary. A static source scan found no process, shell, PTY, host audio,
font, codepage, or terminal-setting API in `TerminalSession.cs`.

### Expanded Emulation Evidence

| Attempt | Version | Result | Boundary |
|---:|---|---|---|
| Expanded run 1 | `1.21.0.148` | 27/28 | C# variable-length `\x` literal in the reset test consumed `c`; changed to explicit `\u001b` |
| Expanded green | `1.21.0.149` | 28/28 | Complete C0/CSI/reset/color/atomicity/63-65/4-5/9,999-10,000 matrix passed |

The deterministic malformed-input sweep uses explicit MSTest rows and fixed
sizes. It is not a broad fuzzing claim and adds no dependency.

## Charset, Font, and Profile Matrix

| Area | Positive contract | Negative/fallback contract | Host boundary | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unicode | Valid scalar identity | Invalid unit -> U+FFFD/Replaced | Locale independent | Pass |
| KOI8-R | Known byte map | U+FFFD is the sole replacement boundary | Fixed table, no host codepage | Pass |
| Other charset | None | Unsupported, no implicit conversion | No host fallback | Pass |
| Raw font | 8x16, 256 glyphs, 16 bytes/glyph, 4,096 bytes | Geometry/count/stride/truncated/oversized/format/path reject | No install/generator | Pass |
| Minimal profile | ProfileId + Charset | Missing/invalid required reject | In-process JSON | Pass |
| Optional profile | Font/colors/defaults | Unknown/duplicate/malformed reject; unavailable request falls back visibly | No host mutation | Pass |

### Charset, Font, and Profile Red/Green Evidence

| Slice | Red version/result | Green version/result | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|
| Charset/font | `1.21.0.150`, expected missing contracts | `1.21.0.151`, 6/6 | KOI8-R, Unicode/U+FFFD, Culture independence, exact fixture, nine negative fixture boundaries |
| Profile/host | `1.21.0.152`, expected missing contracts | `1.21.0.153`, 17/17 | Minimal/full/default profiles, malformed/unknown/duplicate/type/color/required rejection, unavailable capability fallback, five host classes |

## Controls Proof Matrix

| Route | Required state | Visible proof | Fallback/proof limit | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `app.Run()` controlled text/key input | Session, cursor, effective profile/charset/font metadata | Concrete `TTerminalView`, status line, cell positions | No Wave-4 example or host process | Pass |
| Disabled/unsupported capability | Session remains controlled; quit works | Text-readable fallback and visible cells | Physical terminal is separate evidence | Pass |
| Existing key translation | Compatibility contract unchanged | Existing exact xterm key tests plus targeted batch | No duplicate parser | Pass |

### Controls Red/Green Evidence

| Attempt | Version | Result | Boundary |
|---:|---|---|---|
| Red | `1.21.0.154` | Expected compile failure | Missing `TTerminalView` only |
| Green attempt | `1.21.0.155` | 4/5 | Narrow status clipped `Unsupported`; capability moved directly after profile identity |
| Green | `1.21.0.156` | 5/5 | Draw, cursor, status, key input, resize, app-loop state/view/cells/quit, and unsupported fallback passed |
| Targeted regression | `1.21.0.157` | Driver 63, Controls 5, matching smokes 3 | Session/profile/font/capability map, app-loop, and existing Compatibility boundary passed |

## Framework Decisions

| Area | Decision | Existing component | Planned local logic | Rationale | Evidence | Follow-up boundary |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Session/emulation | SmallFrameworkFix | Drivers.Console and Core buffer | Bounded in-process session/parser | Reusable Wave-4 foundation is missing | `TerminalSessionTests` 11/11 at `1.21.0.147` | Full ANSI/VT/XTerm, shell/PTY |
| Buffer/cells | UseExistingFramework | `TConsoleBuffer`/`TConsoleCell` | None | Existing snapshot/cell contract is sufficient | Snapshot, resize, wrap, scroll, history tests | Alternate raster renderer |
| Charset mapping | SmallFrameworkFix | Unicode cells | KOI8-R mapper/results | Historical byte intent needs deterministic mapping | Charset tests 6/6 at `1.21.0.151` | Additional codepages |
| Font fixture | SmallFrameworkFix | Core cell geometry | Raw 8x16 metadata validator | Wave-4 needs reproducible fixture proof | Font tests at `1.21.0.151` | SFT/PSF/compression/install |
| Profile/fallback | SmallFrameworkFix | `System.Text.Json` policy | Closed schema and effective metadata | Eterm/XTerm config intent needs a safe contract | Profile tests 17/17 at `1.21.0.153` | Native resource syntax |
| Controls projection | SmallFrameworkFix | `TView`, app loop, draw buffer | One `TTerminalView` | Primary view/cell proof is required before Wave 4 | Controls tests 5/5 at `1.21.0.156` | Visible example composition |

## Didactic Comment Decisions

| Area | Decision | Rationale | Planned boundary | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Parser publication | CommentNeeded | Complete-before-mutation protects recovery | Two-line bilingual validation-before-apply block | Pass for initial slice |
| Scroll/history/resize | CommentNeeded | Cell eviction and top-left preservation are non-trivial | XML contracts plus focused implementation names; no trivial narration added | Pass for initial slice |
| KOI8/replacement | CommentNeeded | Host-independent historical mapping is not obvious | Two-line fixed-table versus host-codec reason | Pass |
| Font fixture | CommentNeeded | Metadata proof deliberately avoids host installation | XML contract and exact validator names; no trivial inline narration | Pass |
| Profile fallback | CommentNeeded | Invalid schema rejection differs from unavailable-capability fallback | Closed-schema flow plus distinct result vocabulary | Pass |
| Controls proof | CommentNeeded | Profile/font metadata is visible without custom host raster | Two-line cursor proof boundary and status-priority regression | Pass |
| Obvious declarations/accessors | NoCommentNeeded | XML docs and names are sufficient | No inline restatement | Accepted |

## Historical Intent

| Modern area | Historical source | Intent retained | Intentional deviation | Proof or rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Terminal buffer | `examples/terminal/terminal.cc`, `include/tv/terminal.h` | A bounded terminal text view, scrolling history, and visible dialog proof | Managed cells/session instead of byte ring, streambuf, shell/process, or mechanical `TTerminal` port | Reviewed read-only; Driver/Controls tests own proof |
| KOI8-R | Cyrillic Linux/X11 `test.cc`, Linux README and setup scripts | KOI8-R display intent, explicit capability, and fallback awareness | Unicode canonical output; no root access, `/dev/vcsa`, `consolechars`, `loadkeys`, host codepage, or auto-detection claim | Reviewed read-only; mapper tests own proof |
| Font fixture | fonts `test.cc`, `font.016`, `genraw.cc`, `ocr.sft`, `fontcoll.cc/.h` | 8x16/256-glyph fixture, geometry checks, and unavailable-font status | Validate raw bytes as metadata only; no host set/restore, shell, SFT generation, or compressed-format parsing | Reviewed read-only; fixture tests own proof |
| Profiles | Eterm configs/docs and XTerm resources | Named terminal capabilities, key/profile variance, and explicit setup requirements | Closed JSON with safe defaults; no terminfo/theme/resource installation | Reviewed read-only; profile tests own proof |
| XTerm screen/key | Unix `xtermkey.cc`, `xtermdis.cc`, `xtermscr.cc` | Bounded escape handling, cursor/state, terminal capability and cleanup intent | Existing Compatibility input remains separate; no termios, tty opening, signals, palette/font/window mutation | Reviewed read-only; session/host tests own proof |

## Host Evidence

| Host | Terminal condition | Evidence class | Capability/result | Residual risk | Re-evaluation trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| macOS | Darwin arm64, `TERM=dumb`, stdin/stdout non-interactive | DeterministicInProcess Pass; PhysicalObservation NotRun | Host family contract Pass; physical NotRun | Physical terminal diversity | Safe interactive macOS spot-check available |
| Linux | No local physical host | DeterministicInProcess Pass; RemoteCI pending; PhysicalObservation NotRun | Contract Pass | Terminal/backend variation | Linux CI or manual host available |
| Windows/WSL | No local physical host | DeterministicInProcess Pass; RemoteCI pending; PhysicalObservation NotRun | Contract Pass | Native/WSL split | Windows/WSL CI or manual host available |
| Headless/redirected | No physical terminal | DeterministicInProcess | Unsupported classification Pass; in-process session remains deterministic | None after fail-safe proof | I/O model changes |

## Retrospective

- **Effective**: Evidence-first ownership and a Driver vertical slice kept the parser, mapping, profile, and Controls projection independently testable.
- **Waste**: One focused test rerun corrected a C# variable-length `\x` test literal, and one Controls rerun exposed status clipping; both added concrete proof rather than repeating an unchanged gate.
- **Recurring blocker**: None. Physical host diversity remained an explicitly classified evidence limit, not a local blocker.
- **Recommended refinement**: Treat text-status priority under narrow rendering as feature-specific A11Y evidence. Observe targeted solution-level test filtering before promoting any batching rule; no workflow correction is yet proven by two runs.
