# Feature 021 Delivery Closeout

This evidence-only artifact records facts that could not truthfully be committed
to the reviewed feature head without changing and invalidating that head.

## Feature Head

| Item | Result |
|---|---|
| Implementation commit | `bc4da7dc4fb652c08c0c1f17eca5dfbfc26e5677` |
| Branch | `021-terminal-charset-hardening` |
| Push | Pass on 2026-07-12; `origin/021-terminal-charset-hardening` tracks the implementation commit |
| Version | `1.21.1.160` |
| Staged/committed scope | 40 intentional paths; no generated output, `tv203s/`, `examples/`, dependency, or secret path |

## Remote Review

| Item | Result |
|---|---|
| Pull request | Ready PR [#51](https://github.com/hindermath/TuiVision/pull/51) created on 2026-07-12 |
| Reviewed head | `bc4da7dc4fb652c08c0c1f17eca5dfbfc26e5677`; unchanged from push through review convergence |
| Required checks | Pass: Ubuntu/macOS CI, DocFX, Supply Chain, Homogeneity on Ubuntu/macOS/Windows, gitleaks, agent-secret scan, and Claude review; Pages deploy was conditionally skipped |
| Claude/Copilot availability | Claude workflow succeeded without comments; Copilot review unavailable because requester quota was exhausted and is not counted as passed |
| Actionable review threads | 0 by thread-aware GraphQL review on the reviewed head |
| Remediation | None required; no remote finding was emitted |
| Admin bypass | Used only for the one-code-owner/human-approval rule after all checks were green and actionable threads were zero; user explicitly authorized this narrow case |

## Merge And Sync

| Item | Result |
|---|---|
| Merge commit | `8f50c07760f1622e4ff13ec055e2ad25cd433038` from PR #51 on 2026-07-12 |
| Remote feature branch | Deleted and pruned |
| Evidence-only closeout PR | Ready PR [#52](https://github.com/hindermath/TuiVision/pull/52); required because reviewed-head and post-merge facts are self-invalidating on the feature head |
| Local `main` | Fast-forwarded after merge and before creating the closeout branch |
| `HEAD == origin/main` | Pass at `8f50c07760f1622e4ff13ec055e2ad25cd433038` before closeout branch creation |
| Working tree | Clean except the pre-named untracked closeout artifact before closeout branch creation |

## Task Closeout

- T157 and T159 are complete through the implementation commit and push.
- T158 is conditionally complete: no bounded version/evidence follow-up commit was required.
- T160 is complete through ready PR #51.
- T161-T163 are complete: remote gates converged, no remediation was required,
  and the narrow admin-bypass preconditions were verified.
- T164 is complete through merge, remote branch deletion, prune, and synchronized
  local `main`.
- T165 is complete through non-empty evidence-only PR #52.
- T166 is complete: the Feature-021 evidence record is ready for retrospective
  evaluation and Home-Baseline handoff after PR #52 merges and local `main` is
  synchronized again.
