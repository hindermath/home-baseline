## Run Gates

| Phase | Attempt | Result | Evidence | Remaining action |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Preflight | 1 | Pass | clean branch from `3329e59`, `HEAD == origin/main`, `specify check` | None |
| Specify | 1 | Pass | `spec.md`, no clarification markers | None |
| Clarify | 2 | Pass | five fixed decisions; second pass found no material ambiguity | None |
| Checklists | 1 | Pass | four checklists, zero incomplete | None |
| Plan | 1 | Pass | `plan.md` plus research/model/contract/quickstart | None |
| Tasks | 1 | Pass | 148 dependency-ordered sequential tasks | None |
| Analyze | 2 | Pass | 33 FR/SC keys, 148 tasks, no CRITICAL/HIGH/unresolved MEDIUM | None |
| Implement | 1 | Pass | T001-T128 complete; Core, Controls and reference app delivered | Remote delivery |
| Validate | 1 | Pass | 24 targeted, 140 examples, 686 full; coverage/docs/A11Y green | Remote checks |
| Deliver | 1 | Open | pending | PR/review/merge/sync |

Primary implementation commit: `04bd2d6`. The bounded alignment commit closes
task status and sets the pre-push version to the final two-commit branch count;
its own hash remains external to avoid self-reference.

`speckit-constitution` is unchanged because the accepted constitution already
covers this feature. `speckit-taskstoissues` is `N/A`: one dependency-ordered
feature PR is the authorized delivery unit.

## API and Architecture Decisions

| Area | Decision | Rationale | Evidence | Residual risk | Owner | Follow-up or re-evaluation trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Widget | `SmallFrameworkFix` | truthful opt-in semantic contract | `research.md#r2---widget-adoption` | partial adoption | Maintainer | migrate controls only with stable labels |
| Focus | `SmallFrameworkFix` | one existing broadcast, typed payload | `research.md#r1---focus-transport` | legacy raw payload consumers | Maintainer | remove compatibility only in breaking release |
| Shortcuts | `SmallFrameworkFix` | immutable provider-owned query | `research.md#r3---shortcut-ownership` | conflicting keys remain contextual | Maintainer | add conflict policy if global aggregation appears |
| High Contrast | `SmallFrameworkFix` | semantic explicit opt-in roles | `research.md#r4---high-contrast` | terminal colour support varies | Maintainer | driver capability API changes |
| Native AT | `FollowUpHardening` | outside managed text-first layer | `spec.md#out-of-scope` | no OS assistive bridge | Maintainer | dedicated platform integration feature |
| PowerShell Homogeneity helper | `FollowUpHardening` | Existing `check-homogeneity.ps1` cannot resolve `Invoke-HgScan`, still exits 0 and targets `~/STATS.md`; unrelated to 023 runtime | observed command output; no TuiVision diff from helper | false-positive automation result | Maintainer | autonomous retrospective/Home-Baseline workitem; fix in script-governance scope |

## Keyboard Inventory

| Control family | Tab | Shift+Tab | Arrows | Enter | Direct shortcut | Evidence / N/A rationale | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `TButton` | Proof | Proof | N/A: group navigation owns arrows | Proof | Proof | matrix plus existing button regressions | Pass |
| `TInputLine` | Proof | Proof | Proof | N/A: text control does not activate | N/A: no command shortcut | matrix plus input regressions | Pass |
| `TListBox` | Proof | Proof | Proof | N/A: selection confirmation is pointer-specific | N/A: list navigation | matrix plus list regressions | Pass |
| `TMenuBar` | N/A: F10 activation | N/A: F10 activation | Proof | Proof | Proof | F10/arrows/Enter/mnemonic matrix | Pass |
| `TStatusLine` | N/A: passive provider | N/A: passive provider | N/A: passive provider | N/A: passive provider | Proof | explicit-key provider tests | Pass |
| `TDialog` / `TGroup` | Proof | Proof | N/A: child-specific | Proof | N/A: container | matrix plus dialog regressions | Pass |
| Reference accessible widget | Proof | Proof | N/A: group navigation | Proof | Proof | 3/3 real-loop app smokes | Pass |

## Historical Intent

| Modern area | Historical source | Intent retained | Intentional deviation | Proof or N/A rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Focus ownership | `tv203s/contrib/tvision/classes/tgroup.cc`, `include/tv/group.h` | one current child and ordered transitions | semantic text snapshot and descendant shell propagation are new | read-only review complete; tests are modern proof |
| Menu/status shortcuts | `tv203s/contrib/tvision/classes/tmenubar.cc`, `tstatusl.cc`, relevant headers | keyboard-command identity | structured query API is new | read-only review complete; provider tests are modern proof |
| High Contrast / AT | no direct historical equivalent | N/A | modern inclusion contract | historical code cannot prove WCAG |

## Retrospective

- **Effective**: One test command per Build increment made later validation causal; the vertical reference slice combined API, keyboard and rendering proof.
- **Waste**: The first targeted command chained a second `dotnet test` under one counter and had to be corrected; solution-wide filters also emitted harmless no-match messages in unrelated test projects.
- **Recurring blocker**: MSTest 4 strict exception helpers differ from older examples; the optional PowerShell homogeneity helper also failed internally while returning success.
- **Recommended refinement**: Promote a runbook/task rule that one version increment owns exactly one explicit `dotnet build` or `dotnet test` invocation. Validation orchestration must also reject error records even when a helper returns exit 0, and must pass an explicit repository root to workspace-aware scripts.
