# Feature 023 Delivery Closeout Evidence

**Feature**: `023-a11y-framework`
**Feature PR**: [#56](https://github.com/hindermath/TuiVision/pull/56)
**Reviewed feature head**: `f781313ec7f4c9c8f31cf09e768d3f2bb5544905`
**Merge commit**: `7f90fdab2fee1141104ac46d39e0d770aa1f7155`
**Evidence date**: 2026-07-12

## Causal Boundary

Push, PR, reviewed-head, reviewer, merge, branch-deletion and synchronized-main
facts did not exist when the feature head was reviewed. This evidence-only
closeout records them after the merge. It intentionally omits its own PR URL,
reviewed head and merge commit so the closeout remains one commit and does not
create a recursive closeout requirement.

## Delivery Results

| Task | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| T132 | Pass | `023-a11y-framework` pushed; pre-push tracked-secret hook passed |
| T133 | Pass | Ready feature PR [#56](https://github.com/hindermath/TuiVision/pull/56) created from feature evidence |
| T134 | Pass | All PR-context checks converged; Claude and Copilot availability plus GraphQL threads inspected |
| T135 | Pass, no remediation | No actionable inline, conversation or thread finding existed |
| T136 | Pass, narrow bypass used | All required checks green, zero actionable threads, only human approval remained |
| T137 | Pass | PR #56 merged with merge commit `7f90fda`; remote feature branch deleted |
| T138 | Applicable | These post-merge facts required this non-empty evidence-only closeout |
| T139 | External closeout state | Closeout checks/reviews/merge are verified on GitHub without self-reference |
| T140 | Pass boundary | Feature merge left clean local `main == origin/main`; repeat after closeout merge |

## Required Checks on Feature PR #56

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Build and Test, Ubuntu | Pass |
| Build and Test, macOS | Pass |
| Build DocFX site | Pass; deploy correctly skipped for PR |
| Package and SBOM evidence | Pass |
| Repository Tooling, Ubuntu | Pass; equivalent duplicate push/PR run also passed |
| Repository Tooling, macOS | Pass; equivalent duplicate push/PR run also passed |
| Repository Tooling, Windows | Pass; equivalent duplicate push/PR run also passed |
| Gitleaks | Pass; equivalent duplicate run also passed |
| Agent Secret Scan | Pass; equivalent duplicate run also passed |
| Claude Code Review | Pass after 3m55s; no buffered inline finding |

## Review State

- Copilot did not review because the requesting user reached the review quota.
  This is unavailable review, not successful review.
- Claude completed successfully and posted no inline or conversation finding.
- Thread-aware GraphQL returned exactly zero review threads.
- The reviewed head remained `f781313` throughout check/review convergence.

## Merge and Synchronization

- Merge mode: merge commit with the authorized narrow admin bypass.
- Bypass boundary: all required checks green, zero actionable threads, only the
  protected human-approval rule remained.
- Feature merge: `7f90fdab2fee1141104ac46d39e0d770aa1f7155`.
- The remote branch `023-a11y-framework` no longer exists.
- Before this closeout branch was created, local clean `main` equaled
  `origin/main` at `7f90fda`.

## Retrospective Inputs

| Observation | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| One explicit build/test invocation must own one Build increment | `Promote` | A chained targeted command violated the counter boundary once; separate commands remained causal |
| Validation must inspect error output as well as exit status | `Promote` | Existing Homogeneity PowerShell emitted a missing-command error and still exited 0 |
| Workspace-aware validation needs an explicit repository root | `Promote` | The same helper defaulted to the home workspace instead of TuiVision |
| Popup and top-level selection need distinct semantic colour roles | `FeatureSpecific` | Preserves historical default colours while allowing one high-contrast scheme |
| Causal closeout remains non-recursive | `Promote` | Feature 023 again supports one evidence-only commit without self-reference |
